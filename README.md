Explanation for Bank_Data_Model

I have created Bank Data Model which consists of a series of tables.

These tables contain client information, credit information, transactions and etc.

Tables include:

Customer
Customer_Document
Employee_info
Branch
Product
Currency
Account
Card
Credit_contracts
Transaction
log_info

I have added constraints for these tables like primary key, foreign key, not null, check, default.

A Primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. It cannot be a duplicate. A table cannot have more than one primary key.
Foreign key is a column that creates a relationship between two tables.
